# Javelin
Javelin is a reliable message-based network library written in C. It is primarily designed for use in client/server games.

Features:

* Client/server connection management
* Message-based API (for sending large numbers of small messages, rather than whole packets)
* Reliable message ordering (messages are guaranteed to arrive in the order you send them)

**Work in progress**
